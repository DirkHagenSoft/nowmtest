            Realizing common layouts using grids
            To round off this set of guides to CSS Grid Layout, we're going to walk through a few different layouts,
            which demonstrate some of the different techniques you can use when designing with grid layout. We will look
            at an example using grid-template-areas, a typical 12-column flexible grid system, and also a product
            listing using auto-placement. As you can see from this set of examples, there is often more than one way to
            achieve the result you want with grid layout. Choose the method you find most helpful for the problems that
            you are solving and the designs that you need to implement.Realizing common layouts using grids
